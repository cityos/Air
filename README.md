# CityOSAir

**Welcome to the CityOSAir github!**

Thank you for your interest in creating your own CityOSAir device. In order to join the clean air movement, we will walk you through this step-by-step guide on creating your own device.

Here you will learn how to create your own circuit board or order already made ones, how and where to get an enclosure for the device and, finally, how to setup your new device.

To help spread clean air everywhere, we are giving away all of our code as open source software and hardware. We invite all developers to collaborate and build upon our project. 
Everything you need to get started and become a part of our global movement is listed below.
